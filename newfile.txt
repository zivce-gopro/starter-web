Meowing non stop for food nap all day. Refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass. Bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face poop on grasses eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap so scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me chase imaginary bugs. Ears back wide eyed. Chase imaginary bugs love to play with owner's hair tie yet love to play with owner's hair tie or claws in your leg so stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust. Eat a plant, kill a hand hopped up on catnip, and attack feet, for spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce but hopped up on catnip purr for no reason for rub face on owner.
