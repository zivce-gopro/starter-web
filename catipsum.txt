Make muffins stand in front of the computer screen, or wake up human for food at 4am but chase the pig around the house sweet beast, or destroy couch as revenge scratch the furniture. Poop on grasses lick the plastic bag or claw drapes. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) for hack up furballs, or shove bum in owner's face like camera lens inspect anything brought into the house, yet caticus cuteicus. Meowing non stop for food nap all day, for lick arm hair. Tuxedo cats always looking dapper meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans or jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed, or throwup on your pillow damn that dog see owner, run in terror yet i am the best.
