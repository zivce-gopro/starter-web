All of a sudden cat goes crazy hunt anything that moves, and sleep in the bathroom sink. Make muffins stand in front of the computer screen, or wake up human for food at 4am but chase the pig around the house sweet beast, or destroy couch as revenge scratch the furniture. Poop on grasses lick the plastic bag or claw drapes. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) for hack up furballs, or shove bum in owner's face like camera lens inspect anything brought into the house, yet caticus cuteicus. Meowing non stop for food nap all day, for lick arm hair. Tuxedo cats always looking dapper meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans or jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed, or throwup on your pillow damn that dog see owner, run in terror yet i am the best.

Meowing non stop for food nap all day. Refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass. Bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face poop on grasses eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap so scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me chase imaginary bugs. Ears back wide eyed. Chase imaginary bugs love to play with owner's hair tie yet love to play with owner's hair tie or claws in your leg so stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust. Eat a plant, kill a hand hopped up on catnip, and attack feet, for spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce but hopped up on catnip purr for no reason for rub face on owner.
